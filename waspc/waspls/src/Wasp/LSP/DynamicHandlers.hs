-- | Sends capability registration requests for all dynamic capabilities that
-- @waspls@ uses.
--
-- Dynamic capability registration comes from the LSP specification:
-- https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#client_registerCapability
--
-- This is different than static registration, which occurs when the server is
-- initialized: statically registered capabilities can never be unregistered and
-- only some capabilities can be statically registered.
--
-- In contrast, dynamic registration allows us to register handlers for any
-- capability, as well as unregister it. Specific to the haskell @lsp@ library
-- we use, we can also track whether the capability was successfully registered
-- only for dynamic capabilities.
--
-- In turn, clients may only support a limited set of these capabilities, so
-- the LSP allows the client to refuse to register some capabilities that waspls
-- tries to register. See each @registerX@ function for details on what
-- functionality is lost if registration for that capability fails.

-- When these files change, the export lists for the changed files are
