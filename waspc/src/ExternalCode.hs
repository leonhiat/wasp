    --   text of a file that is actually not a text file -> then we will get an error when Haskell
    --   actually tries to read that file.
    -- TODO: We are doing lazy IO here, and there is an idea of it being a thing to avoid, due to no
    --   control over when resources are released and similar.

    --     Don't read files at this point, just list them, and Wasp will contain just list of filepaths.
    --     Modify TextFileDraft so that it also takes text transformation function (Text -> Text),
    --     or create new file draft that will support that.
    --     In generator, when creating TextFileDraft, give it function/logic for text transformation,
    --     and it will be taken care of when draft will be written to the disk.
