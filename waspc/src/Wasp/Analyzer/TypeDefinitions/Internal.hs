-- | Describes a specific declaration type in Wasp.
-- For example, such declaration type could be @page@, or @route@.
-- Declaration type is defined by its name (@dtName@) and the type of its body (@dtBodyType@).
-- Additionally, we also need to know how to evaluate it from the type checked AST into the Wasp AST,
-- which is what @dtEvaluate@ function does.

    -- | Evaluates a given Wasp "TypedExpr" to a Wasp AST declaration, assuming it is of
    -- declaration type described by dtBodyType and dtName (otherwise throws an error).

-- | Describes a specific enum type in Wasp.
-- For example, such enum type could be @AuthMethod@, or @DbType@.
-- Enum type is defined by its name (@etName@) and its variations (possible values) (@etVariants@).

-- | The parser, type-checking, and evaluator require information about declaration,
--   enum, and quoter types, but the specific types are not hardcoded into each
--   phase of the analyzer.
--
--   Instead, this information is injected into them via 'TypeDefinitions',
--   which defines in one place the specific declaration/enum/quoter types.
--
--   This enables us to easily modify / add / remove specific types as Wasp evolves as a language without
--   having to touch the core functionality of the Analyzer.
