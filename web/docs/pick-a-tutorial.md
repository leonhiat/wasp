Congrats, you're now familiar with the basic concepts of Wasp! ðŸ¥³ 

It's time to build something cool and check the capabilities of Wasp in action. Pick one of the app tutorials (there will be more of them with time) and leave us your impressions on <DiscordLink />

[The To-Do app](tutorials/todo-app) is a relatively deep dive into many of Wasp's concepts. If you'd like to get familiar with Wasp on a more detailed level - this is what to go with! Things like auth, dependency management, and operations will all be covered while you build a To-Do app.  

[Dev excuses app](tutorials/dev-excuses-app) is a fun, quick overview of how you can build a full-stack app with Wasp in a matter of minutes. Do not expect any detailed concept explanations, and refer to this tutorial if you'd like to get a fast overview of Wasp's possibilities.

P.S: If you decided to build an app on your own - we'd love to see it! If it's simple enough, let's turn it into a tutorial! Please check our [contribution guide](contributing) for detailed instructions and reach us on Discord.
