Any way you want to contribute is a good way, and we are happy to meet you :)!

Some typical ways to contribute:
1. Join us on discord [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/686873244791210014?label=chat%20on%20discord)](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and let's talk! We can discuss language design, new/existing features, weather, or you can just tell us how you feel about Wasp :).
2. If there is something in docs that you think could be improved or clarified, go to [docs Github repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and make an issue/PR! Or, you can do it directly from here by clicking on "edit this page" at the bottom of each page.
3. Create an issue/PR on [core Wasp repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) to contribute directly to the language and/or compiler! Check [wapsc README](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/waspc) for more details.
