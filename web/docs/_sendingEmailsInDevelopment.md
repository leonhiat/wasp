:::info Sending emails while developing

When you run your app in development mode, the e-mails are not actually sent. Instead, they are logged to the console.

In order to enable sending e-mails in development mode, you need to set the `SEND_EMAILS_IN_DEVELOPMENT` env variable to `true` in your `.env.server` file.
