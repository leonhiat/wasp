By now you've already learned [how to install Wasp and create a new project](/docs/quick-start). So letâ€™s create a new web app appropriately named `ItWaspsOnMyMachine`.

```
wasp new ItWaspsOnMyMachine
```

Changing the working directory:
```
cd ItWaspsOnMyMachine
```

Starting the app:
```
wasp start
```

Now your default browser should open up with a simple predefined text message. Thatâ€™s it! ðŸ¥³ For now â€“ the codebase consists of only two files! `main.wasp` is the config file that defines the applicationâ€™s functionality. And `MainPage.js` is the front-end. You can delete `Main.css`, we won't use that. And don't forget to remove `import './Main.css'` from `MainPage.js` file. 

<img alt="Initial page"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/init-page.png')}
/>
