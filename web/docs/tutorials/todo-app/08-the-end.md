We did it! For all those that followed the instructions closely and created "Build a Todo App in Wasp" task in our Todo App, let's celebrate by marking it as done :)!

<img alt="Yay we are done with the Todo App tutorial!" 
     src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-tutorial-end.gif')}
     style={{ border: '1px solid black' }}

You can check out the whole code of the app that we just built [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/tutorials/TodoApp).

If you are interested in what is Wasp actually generating in the background, you can check the `.wasp/out/` directory in your project.

## Tailwind CSS Support

We introduced Tailwind CSS support in our Beta version 0.7.0! ðŸŽ¨

If you want to style your app with sweet tailwind css classes, all you have to do is add a couple config files to your app. Check out [this guide](https://www.wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/11/16/tailwind-feature-announcement) to learn more!

## Where next?

Well, you could check [the "Language" section](language/overview.md) of the docs for more details on specific parts of Wasp.  
Or, you could use Wasp to build something of your own!
