## 1. Requirements

### Node.js >= 12.18.0

```shell-session
node -v  # >= v12.18.0
```

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing your Node.js installation version(s).

  </summary>
  <div>

  Install nvm via your OS package manager (aptitude, pacman, homebrew, ...) or alternatively via [nvm install script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

  Then, install a version of node that you need (any >= 12.18.0), e.g.:
  ```shell-session
  nvm install 12
  ```

  Finally, whenever you need to ensure specific version of node is used, run e.g.
  ```shell-session
  nvm use 12
  ```
  to set the node version for current shell session.

  You can run
  ```shell-session
  node -v
  ```
  to check the version of node currently being used in this shell session.

  Check NVM repo for more details: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm .

## 2. Installation

<Tabs
  defaultValue='linux/osx'
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux / OS X', value: 'linux/osx'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
    {label: 'From source', value: 'source'}
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value='linux/osx' >
<div style={{borderLeft: 'solid 6px #bf9900', paddingLeft: '10px'}} >

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
```

</div>
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value='win'>
<div style={{borderLeft: 'solid 6px #bf9900', paddingLeft: '10px'}} >

With Wasp for Windows, we are almost there: Wasp is successfully compiling and running on Windows but there is a bug or two stopping it from fully working. Check it out [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/48) if you are interested in helping.

In the meantime, the best way to start using Wasp on Windows is by using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Once you set up Ubuntu on WSL, just follow Linux instructions for installing Wasp. If you need further help, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) - we have some community members using WSL that might be able to help you.

If installer is not working for you or your OS is not supported, you can try building Wasp from source.

To install from source, you need to clone the [wasp repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp), install [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html) on your machine and then run `cabal install` from the `waspc/` dir.

If you have never built Wasp before, this might take some time due to `cabal` downloading dependencies for the first time.  

Check [waspc/](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/waspc) for more details on building.

## 3. Creating and running your first app
```shell-session
wasp new MyNewApp # Creates a new web app named MyNewApp.
cd MyNewApp
wasp start # Serves the web app.
```

That's it :tada:! You have successfully created and served a new web app at <http://localhost:3000> and Wasp is serving both frontend and backend for you.
