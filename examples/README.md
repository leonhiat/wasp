Each example has `src/` and `out/` directory, where `out/` is code generated by `waspc` from `src/`.

Examples are deployed to https://examples.wasp-lang.dev.

NOTE: Right now, only todoApp/ is deployed, and it is deployed directly to https://examples.wasp-lang.dev.
Plan is, when we will have more examples, to deploy them next to each other, each in its own directory, so they would be accessed as https://examples.wasp-lang.dev/todoApp and so on.
But, for that we need support in Wasp for the scenario where frontend is not hosted at server root, which we don't support yet.

Check `Makefile` for build / deploy commands.
