In this example we use Wasp to implement a simple Todo app, inspired by http://todomvc.com.

NOTE: This is an old example, made with old version of Wasp and will not work with the current version.

Code in [src/](src/) (todoApp.wasp + [src/src](src/src)) is compiled by `waspc`, generating code in [out/](out/), which is frontend only web app. There was no manual intervention in the generated code, it is as generated by `waspc`.

Command used: `waspc src/todoApp.wasp out/`.

You can check out deployed generated app at https://examples.wasp-lang.dev.
